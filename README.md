**AI-Powered Mineral Exploration**

MINML develops machine learning systems for mineral prospectivity mapping, helping exploration teams identify high-value targets and allocate drilling budgets more efficiently.

## What We Do

We build data-driven tools that integrate geological, geophysical, geochemical, and remote sensing datasets to predict the locations of undiscovered mineral deposits. Our platform combines:

- **Bespoke deep learning architectures** designed for sparse, imbalanced geological datasets
- **Physics-informed constraints** that encode domain knowledge into model training
- **Scalable data pipelines** for processing geospatial surveys from tenement to global scales

## Our Approach

Traditional mineral exploration is expensive and inefficient: the industry average cost to discover a deposit exceeds $150M. Our models consume multi-source evidence layers from traditional and novel prospecting data modalities to improve targeting precision and efficiency in underexplored terrains.
